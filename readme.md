# current issue

1. when i click on edit station so it is not editing the station shape and marker, it is only editing the station name and code.
2. remove  extra zoom-in and zoom-out button in station.html,the zoom-in and zoom-out button must be visible only in edit shapes button
3.as we have improved the ui off station.html similarly the ui of all pages like platfom.html,etc must be improved and must be easy to control
